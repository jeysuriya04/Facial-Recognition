# Facial-Recognition

Learn step by step, how to use a PiCam to recognize faces in real-time.

1. Introduction
On my tutorial exploring OpenCV, we learned AUTOMATIC VISION OBJECT TRACKING. Now we will use our PiCam to recognize faces in real-time, as you can see below:

This project was done with this fantastic “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV. On this tutorial, we will be focusing on Raspberry Pi (so, Raspbian as OS) and Python, but I also tested the code on my Mac and it also works fine.
"To run it on a Mac, there is a couple of changes that should be made on code. Do not worry, I will comment about it"
OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.
